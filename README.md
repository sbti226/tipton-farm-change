## Change between 2012 and 2022

This image shows (somewhat) the change on Tipton Farm between 2012 and 2022. Due to limitations exporting the layout, there are issues. However, the areas in red are described as removal of trees. The areas in blue can be described as areas of growth, as well as a line of datapoints representing the addition of a fence.

*While the image looks terrible, in ArcGIS, it looks pretty good!*
